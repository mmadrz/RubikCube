# Rubik library used by the app (the code imports `from rubik.solve import Solver`,
# `from rubik.optimize import optimize_moves`, `from rubik.cube import Cube`).
# The exact PyPI package name can vary; install the package you used when writing the app.
# Common choices (install one of these):
rubik-cube>=0.1.0    # try this first if you used "rubik-cube"
# rubik>=0.1.0       # uncomment/use this instead if the package on PyPI is named "rubik"

# Notes:
# - Adjust versions if you need compatibility with your environment.
# - If you installed a local or custom rubik implementation, remove the rubik-cube line
#   and ensure that implementation is available on PYTHONPATH when running the app.
